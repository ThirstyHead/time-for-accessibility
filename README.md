PRESENTATION: It's Time for Accessibility

The World Wide Web Consortium says, "Users of mobile devices and people with disabilities experience similar barriers when interacting with web content." As you learned 10 years ago when smartphones first hit the market, making your desktop website mobile-friendly doesn't require a ground-up rewrite -- just an awareness and some subtle tweaks.

In this hands-on presentation, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) shows you what it takes to make your website or web app Accessible ("a11y" for short). You'll learn the "Alphabet Soup" of a11y, including WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications). You'll also learn about free browser extensions like "tota11y" that make it trivial to tweak your existing website into a more accessible experience.
